# Topor
We are a small team with big <del>dic</del> goals. Our purpose is to develop applications as low level as possible to expose the beauty of coding, kernel hacking and custom OSs.

By doing so, we will not only develop valuable skill for our career, but also share our knowledge with other enthusiasts. We strongly believe that education should be free and accessible to anyone.
