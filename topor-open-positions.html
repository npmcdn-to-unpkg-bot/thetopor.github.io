	<h1>Join our team at Topor</h1>
	<p>We started building our drone with one thing in mind: to learn as much as possible about C, Linux, Embedded and so on. We know that learning is most efficient through practice and hands-on experience proves the most relevant and we want to share what we know with all of you. We are trying to constantly organize workshops and courses on different topics where people can learn what we have already discovered during our work but we also want to allow people to dirty their hands with the drone itself.</p>
	<p>If you like our project and want to contribute directly, consider joining the team. You can do so by leaving a message at <a href='mailto:contact@topor.io'>contact@topor.io</a> or by filling in the form below.</p>

				<td>System Functions C# developer</td>
				<td>Due to the complexity of our Helix drone, we need a way to monitor the drone activity and to debug it remotely. Moreover, flashing the drone with the latest software versions has to be done also remotely. Therefore, the need for a flashing/debugging software arises. This software will run on Windows and will be developed in C#. The main functions of this software is to trigger remote commands on the drone and to monitor various parameters like the voltages, temperature, speed, orintation, CPU load, etc.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Application Framework C developer</td>
				<td>All the decision making code in the Drone will run on a System-on-Chip running Linux. The applications have to share data and to trigger functionality. For this purpose we will build a application framework which will allow two different services to communicate. This application framework is called helix-bus or x-bus and is developed in C.</td>
