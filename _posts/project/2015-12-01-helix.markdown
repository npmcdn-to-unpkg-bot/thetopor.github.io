#### Helix
Helix is a semi-autonomous quad-copter able to both navigate in the environment without the need of any user command and perform various high-level tasks. In addition, Helix will be equiped with a professional camera in order to enable high-quality on-board filming and video streamming. We even think including some VR stuff :)

#### How it all started
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
