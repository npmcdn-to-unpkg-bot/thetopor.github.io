            <p>Hi! I am Alex, but they call me C++</p>
            <p>I was born in 1992 on the 28th of November, early in the morning.</p>
            <p>I equally respect and enjoy both art and science. I want to contribute to the world in every possible way but I mainly stick to the things I am goot at. Some examples could be: low-level C programming, Embedded Linux programming in C, C++ sometimes (nickname C++ is there for historical reasons, don't get confused, C is my passion), microcontrollers and hardware stuff, even PCB design.</p>
            <p>I love to sing, to transcribe music, to take and edit photographs.</p>
